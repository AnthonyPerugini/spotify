I would like to use the spotify API to automate some of the common tasks I end up performing on spotify.


# TASKS TO AUTOMATE:

## [x] update the 'All' playlist to have all songs from each of my playlists on a whitelist
### WL: ['Two Perceptrons', 'escecially you', 'pineapple pizzas', 'some pandora you are', 'koala tea', 'lookin sharp // feelin flat', 'kisses', 'run A way', 'tension', 'dreads', 'filth', 'climb_rap']
### delete duplicate songs

## [x] find all repeats throughout my playlists and report them
### read through all playlists storing hashmap h(song) -> playlist
### printout for all overlaps
